tic-tac-toe game in React<br>


## Background

Followed this [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

Did this to further understand the inner workings of React.<br>

<br>

When I first learned React, I ony used it to efficiently render "static" components, as React would call them. I didn't know how to use state or when to use function components vs class components (and what are hooks). I didn't even have a good understanding of props. This tutorial did a great job of explaining those concepts.* I also used explored other options in React's ecosystem to style my components. Used a library called [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) to style my components with my js file.
