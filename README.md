# tic-tac-toe

tic-tac-toe game in React

## Background

Followed this [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

Did this to further understand the inner workings of React.<br>

<br>

When I first learned React, I ony used it to efficiently render "static" components, as React would call them. I didn't know how to use state or when to use function components vs class components. I didn't even have a deep understanding of props. This tutorial did a great job of explaining those concepts.*

\*Although I wish they added parenthesis to make the helper function that determined the winner more readable (I was confused for a while til I looked up JS operator precedence ðŸ˜­)
